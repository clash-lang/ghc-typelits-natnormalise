* Add support for GHC 8.10.1-alpha2

## 0.7 *August 26th 2019*
* Require KnownNat constraints when solving with constants

## 0.6.2 *July 10th 2018*
* Add support for GHC 8.6.1-alpha1
* Solve larger inequalities from smaller inequalities, e.g.
  * `a <= n` implies `a <= n + 1`

## 0.6.1 *May 9th 2018*
* Stop solving `x + y ~ a + b` by asking GHC to solve `x ~ a` and `y ~ b` as
  this leads to a situation where we find a solution that is not the most
  general.
* Stop using the smallest solution to an inequality to solve an equality, as
  this leads to finding solutions that are not the most general.
* Solve smaller inequalities from larger inequalities, e.g.
  * `1 <= 2*x` implies `1 <= x`
  * `x + 2 <= y` implies `x <= y` and `2 <= y`

## 0.6 *April 23rd 2018*
* Solving constraints with `a-b` will emit `b <= a` constraints. e.g. solving
  `n-1+1 ~ n` will emit a `1 <= n` constraint.
  * If you need subtraction to be treated as addition with a negated operarand
    run with `-fplugin-opt GHC.TypeLits.Normalise:allow-negated-numbers`, and
    the `b <= a` constraint won't be emitted. Note that doing so can lead to
    unsound behaviour.
* Try to solve equalities using smallest solution of inequalities:
  * Solve `x + 1 ~ y` using `1 <= y` => `x + 1 ~ 1` => `x ~ 0`
* Solve inequalities using simple transitivity rules:
  * `2 <= x` implies `1 <= x`
  * `x <= 9` implies `x <= 10`
* Solve inequalities using _simple_ monotonicity of addition rules:
  * `2 <= x` implies `2 + 2*x <= 3*x`
* Solve inequalities using _simple_ monotonicity of multiplication rules:
  * `1 <= x` implies `1 <= 3*x`
* Solve inequalities using _simple_ monotonicity of exponentiation rules:
  * `1 <= x` implies `2 <= 2^x`
* Solve inequalities using powers of 2 and monotonicity of exponentiation:
  * `2 <= x` implies `2^(2 + 2*x) <= 2^(3*x)`
